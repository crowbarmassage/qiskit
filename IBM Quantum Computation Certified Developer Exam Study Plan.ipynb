    "I also want to plug a [basic QUBO tutorial](https://github.com/crowbarmassage/qiskit/blob/main/BasicQuboTutorial.ipynb) I created in Qiskit.  What I like about this tutorial is that while the code is very straightforward, the solution to the scheduling problem combines quantum computation, graph theory, and optimization in an elegant manner.  As a result, one can spend more time experimenting and analyzing than debugging.  The problem can also be generalized to many applications across industries and the tutorial gives suggestions on variations to explore."

    "# Alternative plan to pass the IBM Certified Associate Developer - Quantum Computation using Qiskit v0.2X exam\n",
    "\n",
    "There are now many extremely well organized study materials for the IBM Certified Associate Developer - Quantum Computation using Qiskit v0.2X exam created by both IBM and from certificate holders.\n",
    "\n",
    "I feel the existing third party study guides tend to assume a decent amount of background in quantum computation which makes sense since the exam is about demonstrating knowledge of quantum computation using Qiskit as a tool and not the other way around.  After all, the official name of the certification is \"IBM Certified Associate Developer - Quantum Computation using Qiskit v0.2X.\"  The IBM material from the IBM Quantum Summer Schools, camps, and tutorials are extremely useful but the beginner may be intimidated due to either the length or advanced content.  IBM Quantum's latest series taught by John Watrous looks to be addressing this learning gap. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than create an additional set of study materials, I am presenting an alternative study plan using existing material that aims to build a strong foundation in quantum computation while learning Qiskit along the way which will make passing the exam a milestone of your quantum journey rather than the end goal.  I hope this approach will create long-term retention as you give yourself time to explore the areas of quantum information science that excite you the most.\n",
    "\n",
    "## My 4-month approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Most first semester undergraduate university courses on Quantum Information Science introduce these four quantum topics (and sometimes more) in 13 weeks:  Foundational Quantum Building Blocks, Quantum Communication, Quantum Algorithms, and Quantum Error Correction ([Carnegie Mellon (2014)](https://quantum.phys.cmu.edu/QCQI/), [MIT (2021)](https://math.mit.edu/~shor/Course-Info-435.pdf)).  While there is overlap in these topics, the IBM exam mainly focuses on the first one.   My main goal was to replicate the curriculum similar to these first semester courses over 4 months.  I do look forward to IBM creating advanced certification exams for some of the other topics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "My approach to achieve my goal was to find resources that enabled me to learn in bite-sized lessons that allowed me to make tangible progress, have natural stopping points to practice problems, and, in general, contemplate on how I was filling in the big picture of quantum computation to keep me excited to continue.  As an example, just when I thought I had \"mastered'' single qubit gates by multiplying matrices, I was introduced to the Bloch Sphere which consumed me for a week as it gave me a better intuition and forced me to recheck everything I thought I knew about rotation gates.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I passed the exam on December 29, 2022. But, frankly, I completely backed into it.  I had only decided to take the exam four weeks earlier.  In fact, I really only spent 5 hours in that first week finding good Qiskit resources and about 15 hours reviewing these materials during the last week of December.  I felt fairly confident I would pass even though I had no meaningful understanding of quantum computation just six months prior to my exam date.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be clear, I did invest SIGNIFICANT hours learning quantum computation from August to November and did get exposed to Qiskit along the way but knowing Qiskit was not my top priority let alone becoming certified.  So here is my accidental path to passing the exam with modifications/suggestions that hopefully will make your path interesting and efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "While I have been reading a bit about quantum information science since 2020, due to various commitments, I was not able to take the plunge until the summer of 2022.  It has been an exciting and intense learning experience and one that I am committed to expanding over my lifetime.  I have no quantum physics background, but I am fairly comfortable with linear algebra, complex numbers, and probability which made it easier to focus on the early concepts.  In August, I started my studying by watching (over and over) the beginning videos of three YouTube lecture series by experts [Artur Ekert](https://youtu.be/feixH-rXPVs), [Michael Nielsen](https://youtu.be/X2q1PuI2RFI), and [Yongshan Ding](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfOgkuiMs5qCa8BUrFMumyvPqeoOL-iu8).  I have yet to make it through all of their lectures but I routinely go back to review but always end up discovering something I missed before.  I watched these lectures at least three times between August and October.  I worked on problems from various universities' online courses to practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game changer happened for me in October.  I started an inaugural U of Chicago synchronous online course [Certificate Program in Quantum Science, Networking, and Communications](https://professional.uchicago.edu/find-your-fit/courses/quantum-science-networking-and-communications).  Upon reflection, this course is what gave me the ability and confidence to attempt the Qiskit exam for the following reasons:  I was able to ask experts several questions each week to fill in gaps in my quantum information knowledge efficiently, the weekly homework kept me accountable so I learned the material, and we had two labs that worked on meaningful problems that introduced me to Qiskit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In November, because of my recent exposure to Qiskit, I signed up for the IBM Quantum Challenge Fall 2022 which I completed.  The challenge was extremely useful because it was a much more intense exposure to Qiskit in a way that forced me to be a problem solver rather than just a programmer.  The intuition I gained for this experience gave me additional confidence to take the exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a side note, U of Chicago is offering the course again in the Fall of 2023 and I highly recommend it.  The course is 8 weeks long with 4+ hours of live instruction per week from professors and PhD students.  Be warned that of the 50 people who started the course, I would guess less than 20 actually earned the certificate due to the time required for the homework.\n",

    "# Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Pretty much every quantum computation course requires linear algebra as a prerequisite.  Understanding discrete probability will also help significantly.  Below are some specific topics and resources to be aware of.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear algebra - [Watrous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OiBzfdE2o&list=PLOFEBzvs-VvqKKMXX4vbi4EB1uaErFMSO) Lectures 1-3, [Dayton Ellwanger](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIxlJjN2V90w3KBWpELOE7jNQMICxoRwc) Videos 1-10, [MIT Open Learning Library](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:OCW+18.06SC+2T2019/course/)\n",

    "- Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors\n",
    "- Tensor Product\n",
    "### Discrete Probability - [Watrous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OiBzfdE2o&list=PLOFEBzvs-VvqKKMXX4vbi4EB1uaErFMSO) Lectures 1-2\n",
    "\n",
    "# Quantum Computation Concepts and Terminology to Learn Early \n",
    "\n",
    "There are certain concepts that I wish I was made aware of early so that I could more quickly see the forest from the trees.  I discuss some of them here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The four representations of a quantum state and their basic notation and calculations\n",
    "- Bra-ket\n",
    "    - Also called Dirac notation, this representation comes from quantum mechanics and is usually introduced first.\n",
    "- Vector\n",
    "    - Vector representation is necessary when using matrices to represent quantum gates and is usually introduced second.\n",
    "- Bloch Sphere (single qubit only)\n",
    "    - The visual representation of the Bloch Sphere would have benefitted me in understanding rotation gates sooner.\n",
    "- Density Matrix\n",
    "    - Density matrices are almost always taught last but for me, it would have been better to have been exposed to them along with the others with some basic calculations.  There are a couple of related reasons why.\n",
    "        - First, I had spent a lot of energy up to that point keeping my head above water and I had no space in my brain to understand why we needed to learn a new representation.\n",
    "        - Second, when I figured out why we need density matrices, I felt like I got punched in the gut.  I had spent so much energy learning how quantum probabilities were different from classical probabilities, only to find out that I would be having to use classical probabilities in the end anyway.\n",
    "        - Watrous, in Lecture 1, mentions density matrices and Aaronson goes into detail early in his text, but I didn’t find those resources until later.  While Watrous doesn’t show how to calculate the density matrix for a quantum state, he alerts us that we will need to learn this representation with classical probabilities to deal with noisy situations\n",
    "        - For a brief description of the need for density matrices, read “The motivation behind density matrices” subsection - [Density matrices for pure states and mixed states - Quantum Computing Stack Exchange](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/2347/density-matrices-for-pure-states-and-mixed-states#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20on%20a%20single,using%20any%201%2Dqubit%20basis).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unitary Matrix and Hermitian Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "While I was confident in my Linear Algebra, I had not dealt with matrices with complex elements (again since I do not have a grasp of quantum mechanics) so having a placeholder in my head for unitary and Hermitian matrices and their special properties would have made the learning process more efficient.\n",
    "-  A unitary matrix is a type of matrix that, when multiplied with its conjugate transpose, results in the identity matrix. This property is crucial in quantum mechanics because it ensures the conservation of probability.\n",
    "    - All quantum gates are represented by a unitary matrix to conserve probability.\n",
    "- A Hermitian matrix is equal to its own conjugate transpose. This property is important because it guarantees that the eigenvalues, which represent observable quantities in quantum mechanics, are real numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Measurements\n",
    "- To my recollection, no resource I have used in my quantum computation learning clearly explains when introducing measurement that you actually don’t observe the 0 or 1.  I now understand that someone with a knowledge of quantum mechanics knows this fact like the back of their hand and maybe that is why it is glossed over.\n",
    "- Usually, when measurement is introduced, we see a double line from the qubit to a classical bit to demonstrate a measurement has been made and are told the quantum state information is lost.  It is only later (if at all) that one realizes that when you measure, you are actually measuring some physical property or observable called a Hamiltonian and the output is not a 0 or 1 but the associated eigenvalue of that Hamiltonian associated with the final state.\n",
    "- If explained upfront about the relationship between the measurement basis, the observable, its eigenvalues, and its expected value, the student can be teased with the fact that the Hamiltonian is heavily exploited in chemistry and optimization to solve difficult problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Oracles\n",
    "- Oracles are just quantum circuits that are part of quantum algorithms and are used to encode a specific phase or amplitude of a quantum state to solve a problem. By doing so, quantum computation can often offer a quantum speedup compared to classical algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quantum Computation versus other areas in Quantum Information Science\n",
    "- Quantum computation is a major part of quantum information science, but it's not the only component\n",
    "- Quantum communication, which involves the transmission of quantum information over distances, is another crucial area. Quantum communication leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to achieve tasks such as secure communication, which is not possible with classical systems\n",
    "- Other areas of quantum information science include quantum cryptography, quantum error correction, and quantum simulation\n",
    "    - Each of these areas offers unique challenges and opportunities, and together they form the rich and diverse field of quantum information science."

    "# Bridge to Advanced Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, I give a preview of how introductory quantum concepts are the building blocks for more advanced topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase Kickback -> Oracles -> Quantum Query Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "- Phase kickback is a fascinating phenomenon in quantum computing that plays a crucial role as a building block in the design of quantum algorithms. It refers to the way in which the state of one qubit can influence the state of another qubit in a quantum circuit, even if there is no direct operation applied to the second qubit. This is a uniquely quantum effect that arises from the entanglement of qubits.\n",
    "- Quantum oracles, another fundamental concept, are black-box operations used in many quantum algorithms. They are designed to implement specific functions or computations, and their interaction with phase kickback is a key feature of many quantum algorithms\n",
    "- For instance, quantum query algorithms such as Grover's and Deutsch-Jozsa algorithms utilize quantum oracles to achieve significant speedups over classical algorithms. These algorithms leverage the principles of quantum parallelism and interference, which are made possible by the quantum mechanical nature of qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rotation Gates + Measurements -> Parameterized Circuits + Observables -> Applications in Quantum Optimization, Machine Learning, and Chemistry\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rotation gates are fundamental building blocks in quantum circuits. They are quantum gates that can change the state of a qubit by a desired angle, allowing for a continuous range of possible transformations\n",
    "- This property makes them particularly useful in the construction of parameterized quantum circuits, where the rotation angles can be adjusted to optimize a certain objective function\n",
    "- Quantum measurements, another key building block, provide the link between the quantum world and our classical reality. They are probabilistic in nature and are used to extract information from a quantum system\n",
    "- A parameterized quantum circuit is a sequence of quantum gates, some of which have adjustable parameters. These parameters can be tuned to optimize a certain objective function\n",
    "- The importance of parameterized quantum circuits lies in their flexibility and adaptability. Because the parameters can be adjusted, the same circuit can be used to solve different problems simply by tuning the parameters. This makes them a powerful tool for a wide range of application\n",
    "- Observables (including Hamiltonians) are represented as Hermitian operators in quantum mechanics and are fundamental concepts that relate to quantum measurements\n",
    "- In the context of quantum optimization, machine learning, and chemistry, these concepts are used to define the problems to be solved and to interpret the results. Parameterized quantum circuits, quantum measurements, Hamiltonians, and observables all play crucial roles in designing solutions to quantum optimization problems, quantum machine learning, and quantum chemistry\n",
    "\n",
    "## Entanglement + No-Cloning -> Quantum Teleportation + Superdense Coding -> Quantum Communication and Cryptography beginning with Quantum Key Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "- Quantum entanglement and the no-cloning theorem are fundamental building blocks in quantum information theory.  These principles underpin the concepts of quantum teleportation and superdense coding.\n",
    "- Entanglement refers to the quantum mechanical phenomenon where the state of two or more particles becomes interrelated, such that the state of one particle immediately influences the state of the other, no matter the distance between them\n",
    "- The no-cloning theorem states that it is impossible to create an identical copy of an arbitrary unknown quantum state\n",
    "- Quantum teleportation is a protocol that allows the state of a quantum system to be transferred from one location to another, without the physical transmission of the system itself\n",
    "- Superdense coding is a technique that allows two classical bits of information to be transmitted using only one qubit, leveraging the power of quantum entanglement\n",
    "- These concepts are fundamental to quantum encryption and quantum key distribution (QKD), which are critical for secure communication in the quantum era\n",
    "- Quantum encryption, in general, uses the principles of quantum mechanics to secure data, while QKD, specifically, provides a method to generate and share secret keys that can be used for quantum encryption\n",
    "\n",
    "## Density Matrices + Noisy Channels -> Mixed States + Decoherence -> Quantum Error Correction\n",
    "\n",
    "- In quantum mechanics, the state of a quantum system is typically described by a state vector, or a \"pure state\". However, in practical quantum computing systems, we often deal with \"mixed states\" due to interactions with the environment, imperfect control of the system, or lack of complete information about the system. A mixed state is a statistical mixture of different pure states, each with a certain probability.\n",
    "- Density matrices are the mathematical tool used to describe these mixed states. A density matrix encapsulates all the statistical information about a quantum system, including both the probabilities of different states and the quantum mechanical phase information between them.\n",
    "    - For a pure state, the density matrix reduces to the outer product of the state vector with itself.\n",
    "- In real-world quantum computing, quantum systems are passing through a \"noisy channel\" that randomly applies errors to the system.  Quantum error correction is a set of techniques designed to protect quantum information from errors due to decoherence and other quantum noise.\n",
    "    - Quantum error correction codes work by encoding a logical quantum bit (qubit) into multiple physical qubits such that, even if some of the physical qubits are corrupted by noise, the logical qubit can still be accurately retrieved. This is a crucial component for building reliable and practical quantum computers.\n",
    "- Decoherence is a process where a quantum system loses its quantum mechanical properties, typically due to interactions with the environment. Decoherence leads to a loss of coherence between the components of the quantum system, causing it to behave more like a classical system.\n",
    "    - This is a major challenge in quantum computing, as it limits the time during which a quantum system can be used for computation. Understanding and mitigating decoherence is a key part of quantum error correction."

    "# Cool Things I have learned so far\n",
    "\n",
    "As you study quantum information science, here are some of the amazing concepts and implications to look out for on your journey, some of which I mentioned above.  I have not mentioned quantum algorithms here, which are a whole set of cool discoveries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fundamental concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interference and Superposition are the computational power of quantum science\n",
    "- Quantum interference and superposition are two fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics that are leveraged in quantum computing\n",
    "- Interference refers to the ability of quantum states to interfere with each other, leading to the cancellation or amplification of probabilities\n",
    "- Superposition, on the other hand, is the ability of a quantum system to be in multiple states at the same time\n",
    "- These principles allow quantum computers to explore a vast number of possibilities simultaneously, potentially solving certain types of problems much more quickly than classical computers\n",
    "- What makes this cool is that these phenomena don't have analogues in classical physics. The ability for quantum states to interfere and exist in superpositions allows quantum computers to perform complex calculations in ways that would be impossible for a classical computer. This is the heart of the quantum advantage, and it opens up new possibilities for computation, encryption, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Entanglement is the power of communication and encryption\n",
    "- Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked, and the state of one particle is immediately connected to the state of the other, no matter the distance between them\n",
    "- This property is used in quantum cryptography, specifically in Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), to ensure secure communication. If an eavesdropper tries to intercept the communication, the entangled states would be disturbed and the parties would know about the intrusion\n",
    "- Quantum entanglement is one of the most mysterious and fascinating aspects of quantum mechanics. The fact that it can be used for ultra-secure communication in quantum cryptography is a powerful demonstration of how quantum phenomena can have practical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase kickback\n",
    "- Phase kickback is a quantum computing phenomenon where the phase change from one qubit is 'kicked back' into another qubit. This is used in many quantum algorithms, including the famous quantum phase estimation algorithm\n",
    "- This is an interesting quantum phenomenon where an operation on one qubit can affect another qubit, even without a direct interaction showcasing the interconnectedness of quantum states.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reversible Gates\n",
    "- In quantum computing, all gates are reversible, meaning they can be undone by applying another quantum gate. This is in contrast to classical computing, where some operations are not reversible\n",
    "- Reversible computing is a model of computing where the computational process to some extent is reversible, i.e., time-invertible. The fact that all operations in quantum computing are reversible is a stark contrast to classical computing\n",
    "- This has important implications for the efficiency of computation, as reversible operations don't inherently produce heat, potentially allowing for more energy-efficient computing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results and implications\n",
    "\n",
    "### Square root of the X gate\n",
    "- The X gate in quantum computing is a type of Pauli gate, equivalent to a NOT gate in classical computing. The square root of the X gate, often denoted as √X or SX, is a quantum gate that, when applied twice, performs an X gate operation. It's a more complex operation that involves a change in the phase of the quantum state\n",
    "- The concept of taking the square root of an operation is not something we see in classical computing. This is a unique feature of quantum mechanics where operations can be done in a superposition of states, leading to new possibilities for computation\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Solovay–Kitaev theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solovay%E2%80%93Kitaev_theorem)\n",
    "- The Solovay-Kitaev theorem is a result in quantum computing which states that any unitary operation (a type of quantum gate) can be approximated to arbitrary precision by a sequence of gates from a fixed, finite set of gates. This is a fundamental theorem that underlies the feasibility of universal quantum computing\n",
    "- This theorem is cool because it provides a theoretical foundation for the feasibility of quantum computing. It essentially says that any quantum operation can be approximated with a high degree of precision using only a finite set of quantum gates, which is a key requirement for building a practical quantum computer\n",
    "\n",
    "### Super dense coding\n",
    "- Superdense coding is a quantum communication protocol that allows a party to send two classical bits of information by sending only one qubit, using previously shared entanglement\n",
    "- This protocol is fascinating because it allows for more information to be sent than would be possible in classical systems. It's a powerful demonstration of how quantum mechanics can be leveraged to enhance communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "### No Cloning and Quantum Teleportation\n",
    "- The no-cloning theorem is a result in quantum mechanics that states it is impossible to create an identical copy of an arbitrary unknown quantum state\n",
    "- Quantum teleportation is a process by which a quantum state can be transmitted from one location to another, with the help of classical communication and previously shared quantum entanglement\n",
    "- The no-cloning theorem is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics that has profound implications for information security.\n",
    "- Quantum teleportation sounds like science fiction, but it's a real process in quantum mechanics where information can be transmitted instantaneously across space, which could revolutionize communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantum error correction can fix continuous errors with discrete error correction techniques\n",
    "- Quantum error correction is a set of techniques for maintaining coherence and correcting errors in quantum computers. Despite the continuous nature of quantum information, it is possible to protect it using discrete (digital) error correction codes, which can correct for errors that occur in quantum bits (qubits)\n",
    "- This is interesting because it shows how the challenges of quantum computing, such as the fragility of quantum states, can be overcome. It's a crucial area of research for making reliable, practical quantum computers a reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) role in quantum speedup\n",
    "- The Quantum Fourier Transform is a quantum algorithm for performing the Fourier transform on a quantum state.\n",
    "- The QFT can be implemented much more efficiently than the classical Fourier transform, which is a key factor in the speedup provided by some quantum algorithms, most notably Shor's algorithm for factoring large numbers\n",
    "- What makes the QFT cool is not just its efficiency, but also the fact that it's a prime example of how quantum mechanics can fundamentally transform our approach to computation\n",
    "- The QFT takes advantage of the principles of superposition and interference to perform a complex mathematical operation in a way that would be impossible for a classical computer\n",
    "- This highlights the potential of quantum computing to revolutionize fields like cryptography, where the ability to factor large numbers quickly could have profound implications\n"
